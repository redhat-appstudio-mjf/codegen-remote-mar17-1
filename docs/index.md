# AI Software Template

This application, codegen-remote-mar17-1, is created from an AI Software Template. These software templates create a new source code repository as well as a new GitOps deployment repository.

The chosen sample source applicable is included in the source code repository.

## Sample Source Application

A Large Language Model (LLM)-enabled streamlit code generation application. This specialized bot helps with code related queries.
